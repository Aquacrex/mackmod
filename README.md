#### A dwarf fortress mod for the twitch streamer Trashmack

>It is focused on two things:
>>Tea
>>and Trash

You will have to add the .txt files to your DwarfFortress/raw/objects folder.
Your the entity file is a copy of the vanilla one with some extra stuff on it so just replace the vanilla one.
## Do not put the files folder into the objects folder! Just the files in it!

Note: If you are using a texture pack, the textures from the mod might be a little wonky (maybe the trashcan will look like a cat).
